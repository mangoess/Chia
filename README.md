### Giving millions of Neo Points!

# TERMS OF USE
As of the Term's and conditions of the Neopet's Terms of Use, This program fall's under (Ad's and Malware), this program does not give you a virus but it does interfere and send request's on your behalf, so technically, neopet's doesn't allow it.

# Why am I doing this anyways?
I want to experiment, if this legimitely does work, this project will be sent to the correct personnell and will be either archived / deleted, if the NeoPet's Team does not respond to my claim this project will be open till they do
